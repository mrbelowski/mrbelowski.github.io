<h1>Crew Chief privacy policy</h1>
<p/>
In accordance with GooglePlay terms and conditions, apps which request certain permissions must provide a privacy policy. These permissions include 'record audio', which Crew Chief uses.
<p/>
Crew Chief ("the app") collects no data, personal or otherwise. 
<p/>
The app requests permission to record audio in order to provide speech recognition capabilities. This audio data is streamed directly to the app's speech recognition component and is then immediately discarded. It is not saved locally on the device or anywhere else, nor it is sent to an external server or used in any way other than to provide speech recognition capabilities.
<p/>
The app requests access to the device's file system to allow new sounds to be added to the app, should the user want to do this.
<p/>
The app records no personal information at all and sends no data to anyone.
